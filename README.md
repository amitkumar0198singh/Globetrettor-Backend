# Globetrotter - Travel Guessing Game API

Globetrotter is a full-stack travel guessing game web app where players receive AI-generated destination clues and attempt to guess the correct location. The game includes a leaderboard, a challenge-a-friend feature, and a scoring system. This repository contains the backend API built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF).

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in users without using Djangoâ€™s default authentication model.
- **Destination Management**: Retrieve, create, and bulk-create travel destinations.
- **Game Logic**: Start a game session, receive clues, make guesses, and track scores.
- **Leaderboard**: Track and update users' highest scores.
- **Challenge a Friend**: Invite friends to play via a shareable link.
